# Intro to ML CW2
part1_nn_lib: Implementation of neural network library. Create a neural network model with provided classes. Includes MultiLayerNetwork class which can be used to implement multi linear layer network with ReLU or sigmoid actviation functions, data preprocessor, model trainer.
part2_house_value_regression: Implementation of regressor class for predicting median house values. Input network attributes and train the model on data.
part2_model.pickle: Trained regressor model for housing price dataset. Load using load_regressor() function.
Load the housing price data reading the housing.csv file.
